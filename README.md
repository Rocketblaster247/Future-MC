Adds blocks from future versions into previous versions. This mod is very incomplete, I will add more as I continue to work on it.

If you would like to see incomplete features of the mod, create a file called "debug_future_mc.txt" in your .minecraft folder.
Incomplete features are Scaffolding, Loom functionality, and Globe banners.
